We're a community of designers, web-developers and data geeks 
who want to democratize access to open data. We're building
a tool to help make data more discoverable, friendly, and accessible. 

If you are interested in seeing a demo, working with us, or just want 
to chat about anything open data, please send a message and come join 
our discussions on our [Slack Channel](https://join.slack.com/t/opendataexplorer/shared_invite/zt-zk2w7qqo-1VImBHr5VWaGjG_3HM8UxA). 

If you are interested in keeping yourself updated, sign up 
to our newsletter. You'll get a notification every few months about 
where the project is headed.
