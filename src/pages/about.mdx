## Mission

Governments around the world publish open data: 
structured, machine-readable, freely shared data 
without restrictions on usage. This is really 
great news, as open data can have
tremendous benefits for society at large. 

The trouble is, even the most common ways of 
accessing open data typically require a high 
degree of a mixture of data skills.

At the minimum, a user of open data is expected to know:

 1. What data set would answer their question
 2. Where to find the data set amongst many disparate sources
 3. Searching through hundreds of tables in a repository
 4. Downloading the data set onto a computer
 5. Importing it into a program of choice (e.g. excel, R, Python, etc.)
 6. Understanding the structure of the data
 7. Transforming the data to fit the requirements of a graph
 8. Finding useful insights in the data

Even seasoned data wranglers need to develop 
workflows if they  want to use open data at scale. 

The mission of the Open Data Explorer is to 
minimize the barrier needed to get to the final 
step: finding useful insights in open data. 

## Current State of Open Data

Most governments use the data management system 
[CKAN](https://ckan.org/) to publish 
and organize data and metadata. This is beneficial 
to the power user, but out of reach for the 
casual user of open data. 

Although open data around the world is generally more or 
less managed by CKAN, there are lots of 
exceptions and modifications. In other words,
there are no clear standards as to 
the structure, content and publishing schedule
of open data. This makes creating a unified 
system of discovery and visual insights 
particularly difficult. 

Here are just some of the government open data sets available
(many of them through CKAN):

(A big thank you to the [Source](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis/blob/master/README.md))

This is why we chose to start with 
open data from [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/type/data?MM=1): a data source
that is consistently structured, well-documented
and comes with an API for machine interaction. 
This makes it easy as a starting point. 
All the data sources in the Alpha come from 
Statistics Canada Open Data. 

## Next Steps

### Build a Community

We want to build a community of open data users
to guide the process of creating a friendly 
and intuitive UI that includes all the
information they need to discover new datasets
and find insights. 

### Continue improving Alpha

The Alpha is crude but designed to show what is 
possible. Making adjustments will be beneficial 
in testing new ideas in discovery and visualization.
